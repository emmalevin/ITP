Ice tethered profilers are observational buoys that collect measurements from the Arctic Ocean such as temperature, salinity, and pressure.
They bob up and down to depths of 800 meters and collect their measurements every meter. 
These machines provide important insight about climate variability and are available on Python with data from 2005-2017
